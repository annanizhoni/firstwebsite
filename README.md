# Anna Nizhoni's Portfolio

My name is Anna; I am a multimedia artist, musician, and student attending the MIT xPro full-stack web development bootcamp. This portfolio will showcase this new path towards becoming a software engineer.

# Projects

The development of this portfolio is my main focus at this time. I have set a goal for myself to code a new piece of it everyday with the end result being a beautiful home for my coding creations. Future projects include websites for an automotive repair shop, a paper flower business, and an e-commerce platform for native American artisans. 

# Personal

I am a lifelong Utahn. I have a wide ranging skillset from fine art and classical piano to wilderness survival and auto mechanics, but found computer programming by way of user experience design. During Google's UX certification course, the elation from creating an interactive prototype for an art history app immediately sparked curiosity; how do I build it in its entirety from the ground up? That curiosity quickly morphed into obsession, and thus began my coding journey.
